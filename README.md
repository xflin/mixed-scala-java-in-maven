This is a sample maven project setup for a mixed scala and java project. For more detailed description about the setup, check [my blog post](http://xflin.blogspot.com/2013/08/mixed-scala-and-java-in-maven-project.html).

You need to install JDK 1.7 or later and the latest maven first (3.2.x preferred).
